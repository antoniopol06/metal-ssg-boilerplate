## Create your Skin

<p>Place all the icons you need inside an <code>svg</code> folder in your skin's icon folder. These icons will be merged with the default ones, and the resulting set will be used to generate your skin icon font</p>

<p>Create a file called <code>main.scss</code> inside your skin folder. This will be the entry point of your skin and should contain all the styling of your look and feel.</p>
